###Instructions
1. Clone the repo locally
2. Run `npm install`
3. You should be able to open index.html in a browser on your local machine and access the example.
4. As you add example code and new methods to `src/index.js`, you'll need to re-transpile the code for the changes to work:
  1. type `npm run lib && npm run dist` to transpile the code and rebuild the `dist/` folder.
5. Feel free to make changes to the config files and submit pull requests! :fire::metal:
